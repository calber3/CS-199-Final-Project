CS199-Final-Project

I had to create a new project because I created project with IntelliJ instead of Android Studio.

Creating a YouTube player in an Android app using a Youtube API that implements Kotlin. 
This will allow the ability to sort uploaded videos in unique manners such as by upload date or by likes or dislikes. 
This will also be able to play videos through the app.
